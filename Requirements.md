# Requirements #
VirtualDJScrobbler requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) of at version 6 or later. You can get it at: http://java.sun.com.

For the songs to be scrobbled an Internet connection is needed. The program will work without a connection and store the files but will be unable to upload these until the connection is restored.

VirtualDJ is of course required for the program to be useful.
