The program has only been tested on Windows XP and Windows 7 with VirtualDJ v6.0 and v7.0, it might for example be that other versions of VirtualDJ stores the tracklist file in another format.

The error handling of the program hasn't been thoroughly tested since most error responses from last.fm doesn't occur very often.

If you start the program before ever playing a track in VirtualDJ or have emptied the tracklist file the program won't accept the tracklist file as valid, just play a song and wait until the song is listed in the tracklist.txt-file and try again.

Program hasn't been tested with more than 2 users since I only have 2 accounts.
