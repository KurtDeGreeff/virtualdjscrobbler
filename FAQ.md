Q1. What does a valid tracklist file look like?
A1. VirtualDJ v6.0 stores the files on the format:
```

	VirtualDJ History - yyyy/mm/dd
	------------------------------
	
	hh:mm : <Artist> - <Title>
```

At least one song has to be have been played for the tracklist-file to be accepted as valid (see section 6).

Note: If VirtualDJ has stored a song without artist the track will be scrobbled as Unknown artist - Title.


Q2. Why aren't my tracks that I played yesterday scrobbled?
A2. The program only accepts songs that are played after the program has started.
