# Starting the program #

Most computers with java installed will have .jar-files registered as runnable programs so double-clicking the .jar file should start the program.

If you have registered .jar files with some other program (for example WinRar or 7-Zip) you can run the program by starting a command prompt, navigating to the folder where you have stored the VirtualDJScrobbler jar-file and run:

`full path to jre/java -jar VirtualDJScrobbler.jar`

for example (if you have stored the jar-file directly under C:):

`C:\> "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin\java" -jar VirtualDJScrobbler.jar`
