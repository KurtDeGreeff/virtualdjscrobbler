VirtualDJScrobbler is a program that scrobbles the tracks you play in VirtualDJ.

It uses the fact that VirtualDJ creates a tracklist file from the tracks that you play. The program has the ability to scrobble for many users, for example if you are multiple DJs or maybe even if you want to scrobble songs for your crowd.

The program uses the last.fm submission API to submit the played tracks to up to 50 different last.fm accounts (not actually tested due to the fact that I don't have 50 accounts available but the limit in the code is currently 50).

The program was created by Magnus Tingne, the original idea came when he was having a small rave in his apartment and wanted the songs he played to be scrobbled. After seeing that there were some interest in a scrobbler for VirtualDJ he decided to fine tune the program and release it to the public.

Note: This program has no affiliation with Atomix or VirtualDJ it just uses the tracklist file stored by VirtualDJ while playing. Nor does it have any affiliation with last.fm or audioscrobbler, it just uses their API.
